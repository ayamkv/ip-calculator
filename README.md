# [ip-calculator](https://hitung-ip.pages.dev)
This is a form for inputting and calculating student grades. It reads from a JSON file and generates a form with input fields for each subject listed in the file. The user can input their grades for each subject and the app will calculate their overall average grade.



_very customizable dawg_
